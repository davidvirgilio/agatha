# AGATHA: TASK MANAGER

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 17.0.0, which posed a significant challenge considering the short timeframe of just a couple of weeks. Although I initially began developing the app using version 16, I made the decision to proceed with the latest version.


## Development

While working on the development, I found it easy to get confused about which part of my code was responsible for the back-end. I also found it easy to split the files into two repositories, deploying each on a different platform to keep everything more organized.

This is the front-end project developed with Angular and Tailwind. You can find the back-end files at: https://github.com/davidvirgilio/

## Install dependencies

To run the application create a Codespace in the green button in the top right side of this page.

Once in the Codespace run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

Then install the Angular CLI with `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

## Run the application

Run `ng serve -o` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The back-end runs in an Azure server: https://agatha-task.azurewebsites.net/tasks
